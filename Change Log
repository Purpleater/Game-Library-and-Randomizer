This text document is used to keep track of all of the changes that I make to this program. The top-most updates are the most recent.

______2/2/2024______
- Solved the issue where the "swap games" option in the personal game list would only do so once per application load. The solution came to me in a dream.

______1/27/2024______
- Gave up on trying to resolve the ugly scroll bar background color. At this point I begrudgingly admit that its hideousness has grown on me.
- Still working on implementing the remaining aspects of the "Contrast" style sheet option
    + (Known Issue) The "Edit Personal Games List" Window and "Color Palette Selection" Window both lack the "Contrast" styling. This is once again because I am lazy.
    + (Known Issue) It doesn't matter how hard I try to throw myself against the task, the stupid white square on the tables refuses to leave me. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.
- Added a method that refreshes the "Personal Game Table" whenever an entry is swapped out
    + (Known Issue) It will properly swap a game once while the application is running. If you want to switch out another set of games, you are required to reload the application
    + (Known Issue) Games already present on the "Personal Game List" show up as games that can be swapped in.
- Pondered making the "Add Custom Point Value" button functional.
    + (Known Issue) The "Add Custom Point Value" window does not exist yet. At this point the button is fundamentally useless.

______1/26/2024______
- Added "Contrast" stylesheet option
    + (Known Issue) The background of the scroll bar doesn't correctly change to black when using the contrast stylesheet
    + (Known Issue) SQUARE. WHITE. UPPER LEFT-HAND CORNER OF TABLES AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
    + (Known Issue) Some of the other windows don't have styling applied to them yet. This is not a bug. This is because I am lazy.
- Adjusted the size of the "Edit Personal Games" Window
- Created the list widget that lists color palette options and allows one to select a pallet to test

______1/25/2024______

- Implemented the "loadJSONData" and "updateJSONData" methods to common.py, significantly improving my sanity in the process
- Replaced all instances of .JSON file access with either "loadJSONData" or "updateJSONData" depending on if the file was being read or written to.
- Started working on the ability to change the UI color palette feature
