This text document is used to keep track of all of the changes that I make to this program. The top-most updates are the most recent.

______3/01/2024______
- I haven't slept in over 24 hours (I blame Avatar: The Last Airbender). At least I have white bordered combo boxes to compensate.

______2/27/2024______
- The "Add Custom Point Value" function works now alongside the +/- function.
    + (Known Issue) The UI doesn't automatically update upon the function successfully occurring. The signal method is busted and I don't know why.

______2/26/2024______
- Good news! The "Add Custom Point Value" button finally has a use! AND THE WINDOW IT OPENS HAS STYLING APPLIED. YOU'RE WELCOME.
    + (Known Issue) While the form components in the add a custom points value window do exist, they don't have any variables or methods attached to them.
    + (Known Issue) For some reason the combo boxes aren't recognized by the styling methods and therefore they don't have a border.

______2/16/2024______
- Added method that reshuffles the list selection every week

______2/6/2024______
- Resolved the issue where games already present in the "Personal Games List" would show up as games that can be swapped into said list.
- An unmentioned issue that has prevented me from progressing on the applying the 'Contrast' stylesheet to the Edit Personal Games List Window
    + (Known Issue) The select/listSelects present in the Edit/Add Games Window lack a border and are (therefore) difficult to perceive
    + (Known Issue) The "Add Custom Point Value" window doesn't exist, nor does it have a stylesheet applied. Ask again later.

______2/4/2024______
- Made it so that the user cannot activate the "View/Edit Game Information" button until a list item is selected in "EditGamesWindow"

______2/2/2024______
- Solved the issue where the "swap games" option in the personal game list would only do so once per application load. The solution came to me in a dream.
    + (Known Issue) Games already present on the "Personal Game List" show up as games that can be swapped in.

______1/27/2024______
- Gave up on trying to resolve the ugly scroll bar background color. At this point I begrudgingly admit that its hideousness has grown on me.
- Still working on implementing the remaining aspects of the "Contrast" style sheet option
    + (Known Issue) The "Edit Personal Games List" Window and "Color Palette Selection" Window both lack the "Contrast" styling.
    + (Known Issue) It doesn't matter how hard I try to throw myself against the task, the stupid white square on the tables refuses to leave me. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.
- Added a method that refreshes the "Personal Game Table" whenever an entry is swapped out
    + (Known Issue) It will properly swap a game once while the application is running. If you want to switch out another set of games, you are required to reload the application
    + (Known Issue) Games already present on the "Personal Game List" show up as games that can be swapped in.
- Pondered making the "Add Custom Point Value" button functional.
    + (Known Issue) The "Add Custom Point Value" window does not exist yet. At this point the button is fundamentally useless.

______1/26/2024______
- Added "Contrast" stylesheet option
    + (Known Issue) The background of the scroll bar doesn't correctly change to black when using the contrast stylesheet
    + (Known Issue) SQUARE. WHITE. UPPER LEFT-HAND CORNER OF TABLES AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
    + (Known Issue) Some of the other windows don't have styling applied to them yet. This is not a bug. This is because I am lazy.
- Adjusted the size of the "Edit Personal Games" Window
- Created the list widget that lists color palette options and allows one to select a pallet to test

______1/25/2024______

- Implemented the "loadJSONData" and "updateJSONData" methods to common.py, significantly improving my sanity in the process
- Replaced all instances of .JSON file access with either "loadJSONData" or "updateJSONData" depending on if the file was being read or written to.
- Started working on the ability to change the UI color palette feature
