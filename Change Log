- Added "Contrast" stylesheet option
    + (Known Issue) The background of the scroll bar doesn't correctly change to black when using the contrast stylesheet
    + (Known Issue) SQUARE. WHITE. UPPER LEFT-HAND CORNER OF TABLES AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
    + (Known Issue) Some of the other windows don't have styling applied to them yet. This is not a bug. This is because I am lazy.
