- Also added more logProcess functions for further debugging

______7/17/2024______
- Added a new stylesheet
- Started attempting to restructure the application where the game of the week gets rerolled alongside the other information contents
    + (Known Issue) This doesn't work
    + (Known Issue) Also the toggle function is still wonky

______7/15/2024______
- Actually re-implemented the overhauled 'save table information' function

______7/12/2024______
- Located and fixed an issue that would prevent the personal games list from loading upon a weekly reset.

______7/6/2024______
- Continued adjusting styling
+ (Known Issue) the toggle feature has kicked the bucket. Currently looking into the issue.

______7/2/2024______
- Added the Aurora stylesheet

______6/28/2024______
- Implemented a means of updating table information after a game's title/information has been updated

______6/17/2024______
- Readjusted the table layout to include labels specifying what each table is
- Attempting (key word here) to add a means of updating table information after a game's title has been updated.
    + (Known Issue) I think I might have maxed out my signal slots for main. I am currently investigating the issue
    
______6/11/2024______
- Tested the implementation of the custom spreadsheet add option and hammered out the up-front issues
- Added the "Flashbang" stylesheet (ow)

______6/10/2024______
- Made some adjustments to text color on the "black-space" stylesheet
- Set a maximum character limit for hex code inputs
- Discovered that hex code validation methods look like block chain codes
    - (Known Issue) I want to learn how this works before I implement this
- Pretty sure I correctly implemented the ability to add custom stylesheets. I'll have to get back to that one though

______6/07/2024______
- Continued working on the stylesheet submission form

______6/06/2024______
- Added the rest of the stylesheet submission form
- Created a system that prevents the user from continuing to the next step of the submission process until all of the fields are filled to some sort of capacity.

______6/04/2024______
- Changed up some of the values for the black space styling
- Made the styling of the more particular widgets (i.e inputLines, Comboboxes, etc.) more dynamic to allow for the implementation of new stylesheets
- Starting to implement the ability for the user to add in details to the more specific styling points

______6/01/2024______
- Made the theme-loading methods more robust. That way users will be able to handle the navigation of custom theme stylesheets
- Fixed a small error where the adjustment of the wording in the custom point adjustment window prevented a user from adding points

______5/30/2024______
- Finished applying styling all parts of the application
- Alleviated a very temporary error where the "sunset" color theme would make the selected list item text and background color the same.
- Adjusted the wording on the positive/negative combo box in the points adjustment window
- Deleted some old comments that don't matter anymore
- Implemented the code that allows you add custom stylesheets to the Color Palettes file directory.
    + (Known Issue) This feature isn't fully flushed out yet, so it lacks the ability to add a name to the UI list and also the ability to style more...tricky aspects.
- Created a function that checks to make sure the user isn't adding a custom styling sheet that shares a name already present in the directory


______5/29/2024______
- Created a function and signal set that closes the entire application window after completely resetting application data
- Fixed the issue where styling to particular parts of the program wouldn't be applied upon load
- Added a method that allows for the styling of the search field in the editPersonalGamesList Swap-In menu
- Removed the annoying white border from various input boxes
    + (Known Issue) Currently these input boxes aren't exactly easily recognizable as, well, input boxes. I plan to adjust this later.

______5/26/2024______
- Adjusted a function that helps to reduce the bloat of confirmation windows and makes it so that all confirmation windows route back to the same function
- Fixed a few grammatical errors. Don't know where they are? Exactly.
- Removed a function that was no longer important
    + (Known Issues) Stuff (I would elaborate further but I'm too tired just know that I'm aware of multiple issues)

______5/23/2024______
- Completed the function that allows the user to completely reset the application data

______5/22/2024______
- Deleted a function that is no longer necessary
- Adapted the entire process of swapping out games in the personal games list to recognize the new id-based search system

______5/21/2024______
- Adjusted the table information system to make it so that the contents of the tables will load based off of game IDs and not game names.
- Made it so that the game lists in the JSON files store the IDs of games correctly upon a new list being generated.
    + (Known Issue) I have yet to apply this to the personal games list
- Added a confirmation window that helps to indicate when the saving of a game was successful

______5/17/2024______
- Adjusted how the game of the week is loaded. Instead of a name being statically saved it will use the game's id instead. This is done for the purpose of streamlining
  the ability to reset application data so that the user won't have to wait a week to have a game of the week loaded.
- ????Apparently removed an entire block of code that was duplicated at the time of implementation????
  This is why you don't program past 3am kids.

______5/16/2024______
- Created a back button for the window that makes you input the word 'cheeseburger' to check to see if you want to reset all of the application's data.
- Started writing the code that will allow for the user to fully reset the application's data.
    + (Known Issue) The code hasn't been fully implemented to link with the json files

______5/13/2024______
- Added the second part of the confirmation to reset all of the application's save data. Will start on the actual function next time I pick this up.
- Created the toggleWidgetsMenu and connected the allocated navigation buttons (the button that takes you to and from the menu)

______5/11/2024______
- Created the "strange-waters" stylesheet
    + (Known Issue) Most of the styling is finished however not all of it
- Removed the ColorModeSelectionWindow since all of its functions have been migrated to the options menu
- Connected the signal that allows for the "Close Window" button in the options menu to actually do its job

______5/8/2024______
- Managed to solve an issue with signals relaying information in the new EPGLW (EditPersonalGamesListWindow) menu
- Implemented complete (and not faulty) "return to previous menu" buttons (aka. back buttons) for the EPGLW.
- Adapted old EPGLW functions (such as the actual swapping and updating functions) into the new class system.
- Added a "layover" signal that allows the menu to refresh the personal games list table (aka. migrating the old function over)

______5/2/2024______
- Started working on the new personal games list menu
    + (Known Issue) currently encountering problems with signals. No, I don't want to talk about it.

______5/1/2024______
- Finished the migration if the color-selection window into the options menu
- Created a specialized dynamic method that allows a user to return to the main menu regardless of where they are in the options menu.
  The reason I could not simply use the standard CloseWindowRequest() method is because that hides the window instead of returning to the menu.
- Removed the old theme selection button because it's not longer needed in its current state.
    + (Known Issue) After switching out one game with another while the application is running, the EditPersonalGameListWindow still loads the incorrect widgets and info.
                    I plan to alleviate this by switching the layout if the EditPersonalGameListWindow to a stacked layout
                    now that I understand how to create one.

______4/29/2024______
- Adjusted the list of widgets so that all of the widgets load directly into the widget list in main instead of needing to be added during runtime. Don't ask me why I didn't do this earlier.
- Changed the naming of a button to better indicate its intended purpose.
- Started migrating the options of the color-selection menu into the allocated options menu panel
    + (Known Issue) The migration isn't done yet.

______4/26/2024______
- Created an options menu and hooked up said menu to the main application (allowing the window to show itself and loading styling, etc.).
- Begun the migration of the "Change UI Color Palette" to the options menu
- Started listing out what features I want to be present inside of the options menu.

______4/25/2024______
- Finished working on the system mentioned in yesterday's log. It might still be a bit janky but it's there.
- Added logProccess() functions to the new implementation because I think I'm gonna need to keep a close watch on this thing for the time being.
- Added a closeWindowRequest() function that occurs upon a new game being added.

______4/24/2024______
- Started working on having the system store the id of a selected game so that the game's name can be edited as well. I have a headache so this didn't go too far.

______4/21/2024______
- Created an entirely different kind of save information function because it caused the program to shit itself upon an automatic reroll
- Created a form that allows the user to manually input a name for a custom stylesheet
- Altered the color palette list to be dynamic (and therefore allows a user to eventually add custom stylesheets)

______4/19/2024______
- Created half of a feature that allows one to add their own custom stylesheets

______4/14/2024______
- Added more logs to specific processes. I don't think I'll ever be using them, but it's still better safe than sorry
- Got rid of some more unneeded code (other functions elsewhere rendered it obsolete)
- Implemented confirmation window that asks if the user wants to save the currently present table information

______4/12/2024______
- Created a function that prompts the user if they want to close the window after certain functions (i.e a UI color change)
- Applied the before-mentioned function to several processes in the application
- I really hated that yellow scroll bar in the black-space stylesheet so I got rid of it
- The game deletion function now works and resets the page upon a game being deleted

______4/9/2024______
- Altered most components of the Black-Space styling
    + (Known Issue) Not really a known issue but I kinda hate the yellow scrollbar. Might update later.
- Apparently the personal games table stopped updating when I switched out games :eyeroll: I fixed this.
- Stole the function from the EditGamesWindow that disables the submit button until an item is selected from the list and added it to EditPersonalGamesList submission button
- Added more log points

______4/8/2024______
- Bolded the table headers in the "sunset" color scheme to make them more visible.
- Fully applied specific styling to all widgets that need it for now.
    + (Known Issue) Currently trying to apply styling to input fields to make text more visible. This has only been partially successful.
- Adjusted the "Duplicate Game Check" window to display a more accurate message.
- Added a "Delete Game" button to the EditGamesWindow.
    + (Known Issue) This button doesn't do anything yet.
- Added a "Black-Space" style.
    + (Known Issue) Don't look at it yet it looks like shit and very similar to "Contrast"

______4/6/2024______
- Adjusted main window size
- Removed some stuff from ColorModeSelectionWindow that was no longer required due to altered styling methods
- Added logging to more user events
- Altered the specific styling (for things such as comboboxes and table widget corners) to be dynamic
    + (Known Issue?) I have a hunch that a couple of styling instances have flown under the radar.

______4/4/2024______
- The button to save an applied color palette finally exists!
- Created a global variable that stores the presently applied color palette
- Created a function that utilizes the before-mentioned global variable to save a currently applied palette to JSON.
- Touched up both stylesheets a bit
- Added functions to log more user event procedures
- Fixed an issue where the "confirm custom point value addition" window would only showcase the first integer of a number value and nothing else

______4/3/2024______
- After spending a week on the QWidget styling issue, you can imagine my rage when my solution came in the form of adding a single line to main.
- Adjusted the styling of the 'sunset' sheet to color application scrollbars correctly.
- Started adjusting the "AddColorPaletteToComboBox" to incorporate an argument to dynamically set widget styling. This is not complete yet.

______4/1/2024______
- Made it so that the custom point value input field automatically clears after a point adjustment occurs successfully
- Added the logProcess() function that applied timestamps to certain functions that print to console.
    + (Known Issue) Not all of the processes I want logged have this function attached currently. This is because I'm currently exhausted and don't want to add them all in one go.

______3/26/2024______
- Managed to get the point counter refresh upon submitting custom value working. This was thanks to a friend (if you ever read this, thank you for your help again <3)
- Added a confirmation window that occurs before the user submits a point value
- Also added a process confirmation window that pops up upon a successful alteration.

+ (Known Issue) The search for the button that allows one to save a stylesheet after testing it out remains futile.
+ (Known Issue) After switching out one game with another while the application is running, the EditPersonalGameListWindow will load the incorrect list.
+ (Known Issue) Dynamic styling has decided to shit itself. Currently trying to resolve the issue.

______3/21/2024______
- Re-arranged certain portions of the application so that all windows are initialized upon the application loading, with the methods initially present in other widgets now sending signals instead of showing the window outright
- Lost my goddamn mind in the process.
- Created a method called "ApplyAllStyles" that is *Supposed* to automatically re-apply all styling whenever the sheet is changed mid-application
    + (Known Issue) "ApplyAllStyles" does not automatically re-apply all styling whenever the sheet is changed mid-application.

______3/11/2024 (Again)______
- Removed a function that had literally no importance whatsoever
- Adjusted the styling process so that now it (technically) takes place in the StyleSheetSetter.py file.

______3/11/2024______
- * crawls out of burning wreckage and falls over dead * the table corners are now styled
- Implemented a standard method that applies styling a particular widget
- Fixed the issue where personal games table sections wouldn't stretch to the end of the page
- Removed the CustomValuesWindow module since it wasn't doing anything important (just like several people I know)

+ (Known Issue) Dynamic application of styling is very difficult while the application is running. I am currently workshopping ways to alleviate this issue.
+ (Known Issue) After switching out one game with another while the application is running, the EditPersonalGameListWindow will load the incorrect list.
+ (Known Issue) I still need to add a button that allows a user to save a stylesheet choice after testing it while the application is running.

______3/06/2024______
- Started implementing new style called "sunset", it can be viewed instantly upon opening the map.
    + (Known Issue) Not all portions of the application have styling applied.
- Added common function that allows for QComboboxes (list select widgets) to dynamically apply styling. This function is not the cleanest so I'll likely redo this one later.
    + (Known Issue???) Pretty sure not all combo boxes have this function applied. Or maybe they do. I cannot remember anymore and I'm too lazy to check. Additionally it is difficult to apply said styling while application is running.

______3/03/2024______
- The color selection window now will have styling applied.

______3/01/2024______
- I haven't slept in over 24 hours (I blame Avatar: The Last Airbender). At least I have white bordered combo boxes to compensate.

______2/27/2024______
- The "Add Custom Point Value" function works now alongside the +/- function.
    + (Known Issue) The UI doesn't automatically update upon the function successfully occurring. The signal method is busted and I don't know why.

______2/26/2024______
- Good news! The "Add Custom Point Value" button finally has a use! AND THE WINDOW IT OPENS HAS STYLING APPLIED. YOU'RE WELCOME.
    + (Known Issue) While the form components in the add a custom points value window do exist, they don't have any variables or methods attached to them.
    + (Known Issue) For some reason the combo boxes aren't recognized by the styling methods and therefore they don't have a border.

______2/16/2024______
- Added method that reshuffles the list selection every week

______2/6/2024______
- Resolved the issue where games already present in the "Personal Games List" would show up as games that can be swapped into said list.
- An unmentioned issue that has prevented me from progressing on the applying the 'Contrast' stylesheet to the Edit Personal Games List Window
    + (Known Issue) The select/listSelects present in the Edit/Add Games Window lack a border and are (therefore) difficult to perceive
    + (Known Issue) The "Add Custom Point Value" window doesn't exist, nor does it have a stylesheet applied. Ask again later.

______2/4/2024______
- Made it so that the user cannot activate the "View/Edit Game Information" button until a list item is selected in "EditGamesWindow"

______2/2/2024______
- Solved the issue where the "swap games" option in the personal game list would only do so once per application load. The solution came to me in a dream.
    + (Known Issue) Games already present on the "Personal Game List" show up as games that can be swapped in.

______1/27/2024______
- Gave up on trying to resolve the ugly scroll bar background color. At this point I begrudgingly admit that its hideousness has grown on me.
- Still working on implementing the remaining aspects of the "Contrast" style sheet option
    + (Known Issue) The "Edit Personal Games List" Window and "Color Palette Selection" Window both lack the "Contrast" styling.
    + (Known Issue) It doesn't matter how hard I try to throw myself against the task, the stupid white square on the tables refuses to leave me. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.
- Added a method that refreshes the "Personal Game Table" whenever an entry is swapped out
    + (Known Issue) It will properly swap a game once while the application is running. If you want to switch out another set of games, you are required to reload the application
    + (Known Issue) Games already present on the "Personal Game List" show up as games that can be swapped in.
- Pondered making the "Add Custom Point Value" button functional.
    + (Known Issue) The "Add Custom Point Value" window does not exist yet. At this point the button is fundamentally useless.

______1/26/2024______
- Added "Contrast" stylesheet option
    + (Known Issue) The background of the scroll bar doesn't correctly change to black when using the contrast stylesheet
    + (Known Issue) SQUARE. WHITE. UPPER LEFT-HAND CORNER OF TABLES AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
    + (Known Issue) Some of the other windows don't have styling applied to them yet. This is not a bug. This is because I am lazy.
- Adjusted the size of the "Edit Personal Games" Window
- Created the list widget that lists color palette options and allows one to select a pallet to test

______1/25/2024______
- Implemented the "loadJSONData" and "updateJSONData" methods to common.py, significantly improving my sanity in the process
- Replaced all instances of .JSON file access with either "loadJSONData" or "updateJSONData" depending on if the file was being read or written to.
- Started working on the ability to change the UI color palette feature
