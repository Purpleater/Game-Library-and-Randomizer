This text document is used to keep track of all of the changes that I make to this program. The top-most updates are the most recent.

______4/19/2024______
- Created half of a feature that allows one to add their own custom stylesheets

______4/14/2024______
- Added more logs to specific processes. I don't think I'll ever be using them, but it's still better safe than sorry
- Got rid of some more unneeded code (other functions elsewhere rendered it obsolete)
- Implemented confirmation window that asks if the user wants to save the currently present table information

______4/12/2024______
- Created a function that prompts the user if they want to close the window after certain functions (i.e a UI color change)
- Applied the before-mentioned function to several processes in the application
- I really hated that yellow scroll bar in the black-space stylesheet so I got rid of it
- The game deletion function now works and resets the page upon a game being deleted

______4/9/2024______
- Altered most components of the Black-Space styling
    + (Known Issue) Not really a known issue but I kinda hate the yellow scrollbar. Might update later.
- Apparently the personal games table stopped updating when I switched out games :eyeroll: I fixed this.
- Stole the function from the EditGamesWindow that disables the submit button until an item is selected from the list and added it to EditPersonalGamesList submission button
- Added more log points

______4/8/2024______
- Bolded the table headers in the "sunset" color scheme to make them more visible.
- Fully applied specific styling to all widgets that need it for now.
    + (Known Issue) Currently trying to apply styling to input fields to make text more visible. This has only been partially successful.
- Adjusted the "Duplicate Game Check" window to display a more accurate message.
- Added a "Delete Game" button to the EditGamesWindow.
    + (Known Issue) This button doesn't do anything yet.
- Added a "Black-Space" style.
    + (Known Issue) Don't look at it yet it looks like shit and very similar to "Contrast"

______4/6/2024______
- Adjusted main window size
- Removed some stuff from ColorModeSelectionWindow that was no longer required due to altered styling methods
- Added logging to more user events
- Altered the specific styling (for things such as comboboxes and table widget corners) to be dynamic
    + (Known Issue?) I have a hunch that a couple of styling instances have flown under the radar.

______4/4/2024______
- The button to save an applied color palette finally exists!
- Created a global variable that stores the presently applied color palette
- Created a function that utilizes the before-mentioned global variable to save a currently applied palette to JSON.
- Touched up both stylesheets a bit
- Added functions to log more user event procedures
- Fixed an issue where the "confirm custom point value addition" window would only showcase the first integer of a number value and nothing else

______4/3/2024______
- After spending a week on the QWidget styling issue, you can imagine my rage when my solution came in the form of adding a single line to main.
- Adjusted the styling of the 'sunset' sheet to color application scrollbars correctly.
- Started adjusting the "AddColorPaletteToComboBox" to incorporate an argument to dynamically set widget styling. This is not complete yet.

______4/1/2024______
- Made it so that the custom point value input field automatically clears after a point adjustment occurs successfully
- Added the logProcess() function that applied timestamps to certain functions that print to console.
    + (Known Issue) Not all of the processes I want logged have this function attached currently. This is because I'm currently exhausted and don't want to add them all in one go.

______3/26/2024______
- Managed to get the point counter refresh upon submitting custom value working. This was thanks to a friend (if you ever read this, thank you for your help again <3)
- Added a confirmation window that occurs before the user submits a point value
- Also added a process confirmation window that pops up upon a successful alteration.

+ (Known Issue) The search for the button that allows one to save a stylesheet after testing it out remains futile.
+ (Known Issue) After switching out one game with another while the application is running, the EditPersonalGameListWindow will load the incorrect list.
+ (Known Issue) Dynamic styling has decided to shit itself. Currently trying to resolve the issue.

______3/21/2024______
- Re-arranged certain portions of the application so that all windows are initialized upon the application loading, with the methods initially present in other widgets now sending signals instead of showing the window outright
- Lost my goddamn mind in the process.
- Created a method called "ApplyAllStyles" that is *Supposed* to automatically re-apply all styling whenever the sheet is changed mid-application
    + (Known Issue) "ApplyAllStyles" does not automatically re-apply all styling whenever the sheet is changed mid-application.

______3/11/2024 (Again)______
- Removed a function that had literally no importance whatsoever
- Adjusted the styling process so that now it (technically) takes place in the StyleSheetSetter.py file.

______3/11/2024______
- * crawls out of burning wreckage and falls over dead * the table corners are now styled
- Implemented a standard method that applies styling a particular widget
- Fixed the issue where personal games table sections wouldn't stretch to the end of the page
- Removed the CustomValuesWindow module since it wasn't doing anything important (just like several people I know)

+ (Known Issue) Dynamic application of styling is very difficult while the application is running. I am currently workshopping ways to alleviate this issue.
+ (Known Issue) After switching out one game with another while the application is running, the EditPersonalGameListWindow will load the incorrect list.
+ (Known Issue) I still need to add a button that allows a user to save a stylesheet choice after testing it while the application is running.

______3/06/2024______
- Started implementing new style called "sunset", it can be viewed instantly upon opening the map.
    + (Known Issue) Not all portions of the application have styling applied.
- Added common function that allows for QComboboxes (list select widgets) to dynamically apply styling. This function is not the cleanest so I'll likely redo this one later.
    + (Known Issue???) Pretty sure not all combo boxes have this function applied. Or maybe they do. I cannot remember anymore and I'm too lazy to check. Additionally it is difficult to apply said styling while application is running.

______3/03/2024______
- The color selection window now will have styling applied.

______3/01/2024______
- I haven't slept in over 24 hours (I blame Avatar: The Last Airbender). At least I have white bordered combo boxes to compensate.

______2/27/2024______
- The "Add Custom Point Value" function works now alongside the +/- function.
    + (Known Issue) The UI doesn't automatically update upon the function successfully occurring. The signal method is busted and I don't know why.

______2/26/2024______
- Good news! The "Add Custom Point Value" button finally has a use! AND THE WINDOW IT OPENS HAS STYLING APPLIED. YOU'RE WELCOME.
    + (Known Issue) While the form components in the add a custom points value window do exist, they don't have any variables or methods attached to them.
    + (Known Issue) For some reason the combo boxes aren't recognized by the styling methods and therefore they don't have a border.

______2/16/2024______
- Added method that reshuffles the list selection every week

______2/6/2024______
- Resolved the issue where games already present in the "Personal Games List" would show up as games that can be swapped into said list.
- An unmentioned issue that has prevented me from progressing on the applying the 'Contrast' stylesheet to the Edit Personal Games List Window
    + (Known Issue) The select/listSelects present in the Edit/Add Games Window lack a border and are (therefore) difficult to perceive
    + (Known Issue) The "Add Custom Point Value" window doesn't exist, nor does it have a stylesheet applied. Ask again later.

______2/4/2024______
- Made it so that the user cannot activate the "View/Edit Game Information" button until a list item is selected in "EditGamesWindow"

______2/2/2024______
- Solved the issue where the "swap games" option in the personal game list would only do so once per application load. The solution came to me in a dream.
    + (Known Issue) Games already present on the "Personal Game List" show up as games that can be swapped in.

______1/27/2024______
- Gave up on trying to resolve the ugly scroll bar background color. At this point I begrudgingly admit that its hideousness has grown on me.
- Still working on implementing the remaining aspects of the "Contrast" style sheet option
    + (Known Issue) The "Edit Personal Games List" Window and "Color Palette Selection" Window both lack the "Contrast" styling.
    + (Known Issue) It doesn't matter how hard I try to throw myself against the task, the stupid white square on the tables refuses to leave me. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.
- Added a method that refreshes the "Personal Game Table" whenever an entry is swapped out
    + (Known Issue) It will properly swap a game once while the application is running. If you want to switch out another set of games, you are required to reload the application
    + (Known Issue) Games already present on the "Personal Game List" show up as games that can be swapped in.
- Pondered making the "Add Custom Point Value" button functional.
    + (Known Issue) The "Add Custom Point Value" window does not exist yet. At this point the button is fundamentally useless.

______1/26/2024______
- Added "Contrast" stylesheet option
    + (Known Issue) The background of the scroll bar doesn't correctly change to black when using the contrast stylesheet
    + (Known Issue) SQUARE. WHITE. UPPER LEFT-HAND CORNER OF TABLES AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
    + (Known Issue) Some of the other windows don't have styling applied to them yet. This is not a bug. This is because I am lazy.
- Adjusted the size of the "Edit Personal Games" Window
- Created the list widget that lists color palette options and allows one to select a pallet to test

______1/25/2024______
- Implemented the "loadJSONData" and "updateJSONData" methods to common.py, significantly improving my sanity in the process
- Replaced all instances of .JSON file access with either "loadJSONData" or "updateJSONData" depending on if the file was being read or written to.
- Started working on the ability to change the UI color palette feature
